# Part 1

Another straightforward problem.  Looked at all four sides from the perspective of someone looking from the outside.  Just mark whether the tree is visible from that side, and then count the total number of visible trees.  The python solution transposes the grid to make looping across the y-axis a little cleaner (at least in my head).

# Part 2

Same approach as above.  Iterate across all trees, iterate along all 4 directions and count how far it can be seen.
