# Part 1

Started off modeling the total space, but realized the just the cubes needed to be compared. Neighbors are easy to find. Since diagonals don't matter, adjacent cubes will only have a max difference of 1 summed across all 3 axes.  Cubes have 6 sides, subtract for each contact a cube has, and finally some the exposed sides.  Got this one fairly easily.

# Part 2

I have no idea.
