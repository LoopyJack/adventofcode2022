# Part 1

Tried to initially solve this without any imports, but that proved a little too tedious starting out.  Using a deque with rotate made things much easier to visualize.

# Part 2
Pretty simple once part 1 is done.  Just multiply by the decryption key and run the mixing through a loop


## Notes

Still want to solve this one without using a deque or any higher level data structures.
